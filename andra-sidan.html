        <h3 >Norway is a country located in the north part of Europe also known as scandinavia. The country has a population of over 5 million which is half of the population of Sweden, but just 1,2 million of the population lives in the capital Oslo. Norway's income comes mostly from oil and natural gas from the bottom of the sea but also the fishing and the truism that they get because of nature.</h3>

        <h3>
          There are a lot of different activities that you can do when visiting Norway, Such as nature and the view as it is mesmerizing. 
          Norway is known for  being called the  ¨land of the midnight sun.¨ The name land of the midnight sun comes from the latitude the sun never sets below the horizon during the summer, that's why the northern part of norways is called the land of the midnight sun. To explore Norway in the best way is to do different activities. 
          An activity that is worth doing is  centered around mother nature if you would like to explore the environment of Norway.  Taking a train journey along the land of Norway. Norway has over 2000 train tracks which show a whole different perspektiv of Norway than just being in a car.

        <h3>those who like hiking, Mount floyd is a must. Mount Floyd belongs to the seven Mountains and is one of Norway's highest mountains, 399 meters high and located in Fløyen which overlooks the city. However, if you're feeling lazy hiking up the mountain, there is a train that takes you up to the top in just 8 minutes.</h3>

        <h3>Another way to explore Norway is by ferry.  The hurtigruten ferry which shows the less touristy part of Norway and those are always the best places to see how it really is in Norway and the best thing is you can hop on and off the ferry to walk around the different  places to see another point of view. </h3>

        <h3>But you can't forget to visit Norway's capital Oslo. Oslo is named european green capital and it was named that in 2019 because of the diversity. In Norways there is everything from music, museums, forests and amazing food. One restaurant that is worth going to is Cru located in Oslo, it's one of the best restaurants in Norway which means it's also expensive so when visiting make sure there is money in the wallet.</h3>

        <h3>Now that you have read about the activity there is to do in Norway, we come to the fun part for those that are 18 and older. Norway has a lot of pubs and clubs but they aren't that good if you compare them with Sweden. The club  that is worth going to is Blaze Go-Go bar. It's located in Oslo which is a small town so there aren't a lot of clubs but this is one that has good music, people and drinks but there's a chance the queue is going to be long so be there in time. The bar is open between monday-saturday from 21-03. </h3>
